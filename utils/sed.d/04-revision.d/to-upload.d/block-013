block #013 - comment on editor loading bug from #003

 Looks like a valid test (sort-of) is to gojira! and then
 load the problem block (the one that hangs the interpreter).

 The goal appears to be to remove either hidden control chars
 (they render as whitespace, and 'change the color' (mode)
 of the very next utterance to the right). PARAGRAPH
 .. either that, or to add them where they cannot be assumed
 to prevail (mode is not a guarantee). PARAGRAPH
 What 'gojira! [boot] 3 edit' does - possibly - is it makes the
 immediate environment testable (ex. a hidden yellow ctrl char
 ^C will have the yellow effect on a fresh load, where it was
 otherwise not apparent).
